# Daily Design Challenges

This is a collection of small-ish design (mainly HTML and CSS) challenges, to help improve your design-coding skills.
They are not meant to be that challenging, each one should be done in 20 minutes or less, but they do progress and gradually require more experience, so do them in order.

## If this is your first time here
1. Fork this repository to your own Github account - use the fork-button at the top right in Github.
2. Then clone your own repository to a folder on your computer.
3. Start with challenge 01.

## When you are doing a challenge
Only do one challenge at a time.
1. Enter the folder for the challenge you want to do
2. Start by reading the README.md for that challenge.
3. Usually that tells you to copy files from `assets/` to `solution/`
4. After that change to the solution folder, and start editing, modifiyng, creating, or what it takes to solve the challenge.
5. Remember to commit early and often!
6. When you have completed a challenge, call git push

## When you want to update with more challenges
This repository gets updated with additional challenges once in a while, and you need to update your own repository as well.

Pull the latest changes by writing:
`git pull https://github.com/keammd/designchallenges2019`

Then add, commit, and push the updated files to your own repository.

---
Remember: don't modify the files in the `assets/` folder. If you do by accident, just delete the file, and it will be fixed the next time you pull.
